# C-Neural-Network-Project-2019-
Neural Network project in C

-Used only using C standart libraries

-Users can create topology of your neural network with hyperparameters, neurons per layer, activation functions per layer as you wish quickly with functions at MyNNLib.h library.

-Users can initialize sample set using training set structures and functions in MyNNLib.h library

-Users can train Neural Network they created with training sample set also they created, using train function in MyNNLib.h library

-Users can save or load Neural Network as binary file

-Training is not fully optimized but it works very fast compared to high-level languages like Python and uses threads to speed up backpropogation and feed-forward functions

-Example Neural Network program can be viewed in repository
