# C-Neural-Network-Project-2019-
C Neural Network with using Genetic Algorithm to Train network.

CURRENT ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS: SIGMOID, RELU
HYPER PARAMETERS CAN BE MODIFIED BY MACROS INSIDE CODE

BACKPROPOGATION AND GENETIC ALGORITHM TECHNIQUES AVALAIBLE
GENETIC ALGORITHM TECHNIQUE IS %69 MORE EFFECTIVE THAN BACKPROPOGATION (TESTED WITH 300 ITERATIONS/GENERATIONS)

NOT FINISHED YET, GOING TO:
1. ADD ENGLISH COMMENTS ON CODE,  
2. ADD DYNAMIC ARRAYS
3. FIX BACKPROPOGATION 
4. ADD DROPOUT MECHANISM ON BACKPROPOGATION
